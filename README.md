Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

A simple machine learning web application that predicts the sentiment of a movie review as **Positive** or **Negative**.  
Built using **Python**, **Flask**, and **scikit-learn**, this project demonstrates basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques through a user-friendly web interface.
